        Kevin Na is one of the shortest players on tour when it comes to driving distance. He is considerably below average year over year on total distance with his driver.
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm">
        He makes up for his lost distance by being more accurate than the average player on tour. He has not been able to crack the top 20 in his career.
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm">
        While Kevin Na hits fairways more consistantly than the average player, he would benefit greatly from increased distance.
